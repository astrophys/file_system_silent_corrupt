To Do : 
1. Find os.stat options that are equivalent to 'GetFileInfo'  and 'stat -x'


Outline:
    Initial:
        Get list of files
        Compute md5 sums
        Record access/edit times in class
        Either pickle class list, maybe organize like directory paths.
    After:
        Walk file tree.  
        Compute md5 sum
        Compare md5 sum and access time
        Record files with same access times but different md5. Flag as potentially silently corrupted
        Maintain checkpoint of run
